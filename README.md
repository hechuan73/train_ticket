# Train Ticket：A Benchmark Microservice System

The project is a train ticket booking system based on microservice architecture which contains 41 microservices. The programming languages and frameworks it used are as below.
- Java - Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- Node.js - Express
- Python - Django
- Go - Webgo
- DB - Mongo、MySQL

You can get more details at [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket/wiki).

## Quick Start
The easiest way to get start with the Train Ticket application is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

> If you don't have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can refer to [the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) to install them.

### Presequisite
* Docker
* Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket.git
cd train-ticket/
```

### 2. Start the Application
```
docker-compose -f deployment/quickstart-docker-compose-v0.0.2/quickstart-docker-compose.yml up -d
```
Once the command finishes, you can visit the Train Ticket web page at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
